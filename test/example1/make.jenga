# This is an example with two .c files used to drive early development of jenga2.
# In particular to get the correct sandboxing behaviour.
# The example uses simple rule generation for C build and link. No dependency discovery.

# This example is used by tests 1a..1g

# TODO: As a first example, it might be better to avoid the built-in CC rule gen.
# And instead hand-code the rules explicitly.
