# Jenga tutorial

Each tutorial section includes example [source files](files) and a companion [cram test file](cram) that records the expected output from each step.

If the tutorial diverges from the cram tests, then the cram file should be regarded as the source of truth.
If you don't want to run the tutorial steps yourself, you can just browse the cram files to see exactly what would happen.
